# FGO_Symfony
FGO App with symfony. Used to learn about that framework!
Some things may be weird, but I'm new to this framework (used to work with simple PHP) and trying to learn with an API of a mobile game that I adore (even though gacha sucks)
API link (Thanks to them!): https://api.atlasacademy.io/rapidoc
